# 1) About
TC1A2 project. An Introduction to the real world of Tech life. This document is to demostrate my ability within the IT industry and am I am willing and able to execute basic HTML and CSS functions with profientcy.

A little about myself. After spending 15 years in the Engineering and Construction industry as a surveyor. I felt it was time to discover my true passion and interest in life. Tech has over the years filled a lot of my attention. I felt it was a necessary and natural move into development.

This being my first project. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed creating it. I wanted to keep the site as clean and concise as possible. My intentions were to create a simple yet informative experience for the reader. Highlighting my skills in certain areas. Showcasing what I have already learnt and also leave the reader wanting to know more.

As with most projects, this website will be ongoing. The site will continually be updated of my achievements. Projects completed within the Industry and also side projects tackled outside.
