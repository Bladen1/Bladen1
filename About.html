                        <p> Hey, Thanks for coming to my site. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have have enjoyed 
                            creating it. Let me Introduce Myself. My name is Elliot Bladen and I’m 36 years of age. 
                            After spending 20 years in the Engineering and Construction game I felt it was time for a change. 
                            After having learned a thing or 2 over the years it has come to my attention that you have
                            to be happy in pursuing your goals, passions or both. Money is a tool but fulfilment is not. 
                            It’s important waking up everyday and asking yourself are you happy in the things you will achieve today. 
                            If not, then it’s time for a change. </p>

                            <p>So here I am, taking the risk and starting again. It was ideal that I could take my problem 
                               solving skills over from Surveyoring/Engineering and apply them to Information Engineering.
                               I believe this will help me transition across seamlessly. Solving problems day to day in construction 
                               and working with people has given me good attributes in the area of soft skills. Knowing how to get things done is knowledge.
                               Knowing how to implement them is applied knowledge. This is a soft power that I have cultivated over 
                               the years and something that I will contitpsley learn in my career as a Software Engineer.
                            </p>
                            I do hope you enjoy the rest of the site. Any comments or suggestions are most welcome. 
                            I believe its important to continually grow and learn. Not only as a Developer but as a human being. 
                            The rest of the site is split up into 2 sections. The first being my professional side and the second 
                            show casing what I do away from the computer. Once again thanks so much. If we don’t connect in the 
                            real world be sure to connect with in the virtual. 
                            <p>
